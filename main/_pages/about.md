  <p> &#x1F600; &#x1F44B; <strong> Hi, Shuaijun LIU (George) here. Sincerely welcome to my personal page, which I hope will give you a full understanding of my experience and abilities. </strong></p>
  <p> I received my B.S. honors degree in Statistics from <a href="https://www.hkbu.edu.hk">Hong Kong Baptist University</a> with a minor in Computer Science in July 2023, and I'm studying for my M.S. degree at <a href="https://www.bu.edu">Boston University</a>, starting in Jan 2024. As of now I am interested in data analysis, optimization algorithms and software design in distributed computing, and am doing some related research to try to be innovative in this area. </p>
  <p> My ongoing or planned research interests include but are not limited to: trajectory planning algorithms in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted fog computing, deep learning applications in distributed computing, and software design for sustainability networks. I plan to be well-prepared for my PhD application in order to have sufficient skills to accomplish these ideas. </p> 
  <p> I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://fst.uic.edu.cn/stat_en/faculty/faculty.htm#/Jingjinwu/en">Prof. Timothy WU</a>, <a href="https://fst.uic.edu.cn/stat_en/faculty/faculty.htm#/ivandeng/en">Prof. Ivan DENG</a> and <a href="https://fst.uic.edu.cn/stat_en/faculty/faculty.htm#/evaahzhang/en">Prof. Eva ZHANG</a> of China Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Research and Application for Data Science. The researches partly supported by the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Fund, Information technology category 2023, the Zhuhai Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation Grant (China).
